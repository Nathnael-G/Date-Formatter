## Date Formatter

Working with dates in JavaScript can be challenging. You have to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. 
This project also teaches on how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties like getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods. And by using these we can correctly format dates in the way we want.
